Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This repository contains a Python script that applies the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The clustering is performed on the features "Annual Income (k$)" and "Spending Score (1-100)".

Dataset
The dataset Mall_Customers.csv includes the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the retail store based on customer behavior and spending nature
Project Structure
customer_segmentation.py: Main script to load data, apply K-means clustering, and visualize the clusters.
Mall_Customers.csv: Dataset containing customer information.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/SaiSamhitha06/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
Ensure you have the dataset file Mall_Customers.csv in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:
python customer_segmentation.py

The script will:
Load the customer data into a pandas DataFrame from Mall_Customers.csv.
Select the relevant features ("Annual Income (k$)" and "Spending Score (1-100)").
Apply K-means clustering to segment the customers.
Visualize the resulting clusters using a scatter plot.
Print the first few rows of the DataFrame with the cluster assignments.

Example Output
The script will display a scatter plot showing the customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. Each segment will be represented by a different color.
